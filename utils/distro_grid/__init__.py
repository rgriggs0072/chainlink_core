"""
Distro Grid module (Chainlink Core)

Overview for future devs:
- Centralized helpers for the Distro Grid pipeline:
  * Logical upload schema (schema.py)
  * Formatting raw Excel into a clean DataFrame (formatters.py)
  * (Next steps) Validation + upload helpers.

Usage:
- Streamlit pages should import from here rather than older helpers where possible.
